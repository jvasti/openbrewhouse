		Now what are the possibilities of warp drive? Cmdr Riker's nervous system has been invaded by an
		unknown microorganism. The organisms fuse to the nerve, intertwining at the molecular level.
		That's why the transporter's biofilters couldn't extract it. The vertex waves show a K-complex
		corresponding to an REM state. The engineering section's critical. Destruction is imminent.
		Their robes contain ultritium, highly explosive, virtually undetectable by your transporter.

		Exceeding reaction chamber thermal limit. We have begun power-supply calibration. Force fields
		have been established on all turbo lifts and crawlways. Computer, run a level-two diagnostic on
		warp-drive systems. Antimatter containment positive. Warp drive within normal parameters. I read
		an ion trail characteristic of a freighter escape pod. The bomb had a molecular-decay detonator.
		Detecting some unusual fluctuations in subspace frequencies.

		Run a manual sweep of anomalous airborne or electromagnetic readings. Radiation levels in our
		atmosphere have increased by 3,000 percent. Electromagnetic and subspace wave fronts approaching
		synchronization. What is the strength of the ship's deflector shields at maximum output? The
		wormhole's size and short period would make this a local phenomenon. Do you have sufficient data
		to compile a holographic simulation?
	</p>

	<p>
		Deflector power at maximum. Energy discharge in six seconds. Warp reactor core primary coolant
		failure. Fluctuate phaser resonance frequencies. Resistance is futile. Recommend we adjust
		shield harmonics to the upper EM band when proceeding. These appear to be some kind of
		power-wave-guide conduits which allow them to work collectively as they perform ship functions.
		Increase deflector modulation to upper frequency band.
